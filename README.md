Myprofile Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This site showcases my projects and skills as an aspiring Full-stack developer.

The Technologies I used are:
- HTML5
- CSS [For styling my HTML code]
- Paint [used to resize and optimize images for the web]
- Github [For ]
- ChatGPT â€“ for guidance and troubleshooting layout, tags, and styling techniques.

What I've learned very well so far
1. I gained deeper understanding of HTML tags and their usage.
2. I improved my skills in creating and styling HTML tables effectively.
3. I learned how to apply row and column spanning within tables.
4. I Initially used a table to display images, then explored better alternatives
like the <gallery> tag (with guidance from ChatGPT) to enhance the layout and presentation.
5. How to write a clean and presentable HTML and CSS code
6. How to use Git/GitHub to manage a project(still learning it tho, It's very confusing)

The challenges I faced in this Recent Project
1. Aligning the page header to the right side of the layout.
2. Properly styling and organizing the table content for a cleaner look.
3. Adjusting the layout to be both visually appealing and functional.
4. Deciding on a clean and minimal design that reflects my personality
